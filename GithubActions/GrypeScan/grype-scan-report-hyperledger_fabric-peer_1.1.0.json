buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-3602","epss":0.86309,"percentile":0.99357,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-3602","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-3602","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-3602","versionConstraint":"none

summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or\ndata containing them may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of\nthe OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message\nsize limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those\nmessages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nAn OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -\nmost of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.

It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for

summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or\ndata containing them may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of\nthe OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message\nsize limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those\nmessages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nAn OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -\nmost of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","epss":0.9197,"percentile":0.9968,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-2650","versionConstraint":"none

On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges.

Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers.

Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext.

an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).

an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).

order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small.

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash.

Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys.

The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"talos-cna@cisco.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","epss":0.03272,"percentile":0.86641,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","cwe":"CWE-195","source":"talos-cna@cisco.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","cwe":"CWE-191","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","cwe":"CWE-681","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.23-0ubuntu10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-6096","versionConstraint":"< 2.23-0ubuntu11.3 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.23-0ubuntu11.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"abe66d5c3fe91364","name":"libc6","version":"2.23-0ubuntu10","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:0e06f82cad70239e5ddb40d77e445b009dafd21dd524139dd33b1d69ca105f98","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","layerID":"sha256:ff986b10a018b48074e6d3a68b39aad8ccc002cdad912d4148c0f92b3729323e","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:ff986b10a018b48074e6d3a68b39aad8ccc002cdad912d4148c0f92b3729323e","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:ff986b10a018b48074e6d3a68b39aad8ccc002cdad912d4148c0f92b3729323e","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libc6:libc6:2.23-0ubuntu10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libc6@2.23-0ubuntu10?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-16.04&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-6096","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-6096","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","epss":0.03272,"percentile":0.86641,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","cwe":"CWE-195","source":"talos-cna@cisco.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","cwe":"CWE-191","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2020-6096","cwe":"CWE-681","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.23-0ubuntu11.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.23-0ubuntu11.3","date":"2021-05-15","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.9816},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-6096","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6096","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772%40%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SPYXTDOOB4PQGTYAMZAZNJIB3FF6YQXI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/URXOIA2LDUKHQXK4BE55BQBRI6ZZG3Y6/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-20","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620","https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772%40%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SPYXTDOOB4PQGTYAMZAZNJIB3FF6YQXI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/URXOIA2LDUKHQXK4BE55BQBRI6ZZG3Y6/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-20","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620","https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019"],"description":"An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000.

untrusted\ndata.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0401","epss":0.00945,"percentile":0.7555,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0401","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-0401","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-0401","versionConstraint":"none

summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex()\nor EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long\ndelays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those\nchecks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use\na very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which\nis over 10,000 bits in length.\n\nHowever the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters\nthat have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line

summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex()\nor EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long\ndelays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those\nchecks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use\na very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which\nis over 10,000 bits in length.\n\nHowever the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters\nthat have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the '-check' option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","epss":0.00949,"percentile":0.75615,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-3446","versionConstraint":"none

X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1971","epss":0.00345,"percentile":0.56453,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-1971","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-1971","versionConstraint":"< 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.18 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b5ccb6a85f8be2d4","name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:0e06f82cad70239e5ddb40d77e445b009dafd21dd524139dd33b1d69ca105f98","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.0.0/copyright","layerID":"sha256:0e06f82cad70239e5ddb40d77e445b009dafd21dd524139dd33b1d69ca105f98","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:0e06f82cad70239e5ddb40d77e445b009dafd21dd524139dd33b1d69ca105f98","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:0e06f82cad70239e5ddb40d77e445b009dafd21dd524139dd33b1d69ca105f98","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:0e06f82cad70239e5ddb40d77e445b009dafd21dd524139dd33b1d69ca105f98","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:0e06f82cad70239e5ddb40d77e445b009dafd21dd524139dd33b1d69ca105f98","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-16.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-0464","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-0464","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0464","epss":0.00857,"percentile":0.74266,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0464","cwe":"CWE-295","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-0464","cwe":"CWE-295","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.2571},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-0464","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0464","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2017771e2db3e2b96f89bbe8766c3209f6a99545","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2dcd4f1e3115f38cefa43e3efbe9b801c27e642e","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=879f7080d7e141f415c79eaa3a8ac4a3dad0348b","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=959c59c7a0164117e7f8366466a32bb1f8d77ff1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.couchbase.com/alerts/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230322.txt","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2017771e2db3e2b96f89bbe8766c3209f6a99545","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2dcd4f1e3115f38cefa43e3efbe9b801c27e642e","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=879f7080d7e141f415c79eaa3a8ac4a3dad0348b","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=959c59c7a0164117e7f8366466a32bb1f8d77ff1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230406-0006/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.couchbase.com/alerts/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230322.txt"],"description":"A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions\n\nof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains\nthat include policy constraints.

In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.

To achieve a successful decryption an attacker\nwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for\ndecryption.

Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l).

Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l).

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL\nto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack\n\nImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted\nsources might terminate abruptly.\n\nA file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an\nuntrusted source.

Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fields provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger).

vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-47039","epss":0.00073,"percentile":0.22762,"date":"2025-10-29"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-47039","cwe":"CWE-122","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-47039","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"perl","version":"5.22.1-9ubuntu0.2"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-47039","versionConstraint":"none
