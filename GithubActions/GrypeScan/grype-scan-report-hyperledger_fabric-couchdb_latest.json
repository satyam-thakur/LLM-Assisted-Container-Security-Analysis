addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.

When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","epss":0.00716,"percentile":0.71597,"date":"2025-10-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-179","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"9"},"package":{"name":"gzip","version":"1.6-5+b1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-1271","versionConstraint":"< 1.6-5+deb9u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.6-5+deb9u1"}},{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"9"},"package":{"name":"gzip","version":"1.6-5"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-1271","versionConstraint":"< 1.6-5+deb9u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.6-5+deb9u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"afa188126bb133fc","name":"gzip","version":"1.6-5+b1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:a69110c75a370f154f2e7a04edfa806fb067905613e5b91a62fa9a9a6b9137a2","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/gzip/copyright","layerID":"sha256:e9dc98463cd6fd9852dd890db828f0232e95f0d7ab8b3031864e57df0dc6edea","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/gzip/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/gzip.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:e9dc98463cd6fd9852dd890db828f0232e95f0d7ab8b3031864e57df0dc6edea","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/gzip.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/gzip.list","layerID":"sha256:e9dc98463cd6fd9852dd890db828f0232e95f0d7ab8b3031864e57df0dc6edea","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/gzip.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:gzip:gzip:1.6-5\\+b1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gzip@1.6-5%2Bb1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-9&upstream=gzip%401.6-5","upstreams":[{"name":"gzip","version":"1.6-5"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-1271","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9","severity":"High","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","epss":0.00716,"percentile":0.71597,"date":"2025-10-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-179","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.2.2-1.2+deb9u1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"5.2.2-1.2+deb9u1","date":"2022-04-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5835400000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-1271","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1271","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8"],"description":"An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021.
